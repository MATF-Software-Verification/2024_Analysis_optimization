# Analysis of project 'SimpleGraphs'

The project represents a small, _header-only_ library implemented in _C++_, designed for creating and executing various graph algorithms. The primary goal of this library is to provide flexibility in graph handling, allowing nodes and edges to contain different types of data. All algorithms are implemented generically to support a wide range of use cases. Additionally, a key objective is to make the library easy to understand and use.
